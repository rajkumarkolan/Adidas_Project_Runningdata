# Adidas_Project_Runningdata


Project Description: In this project, we implement a deep neural network to classify a time series sequence into a class label. This is a multi
variate multi class problem. The architectures we will explore on this project are all based on LSTM networks.

Project Constraints: Core Technologies Python, Python Frameworks, Keras, Tensorflow, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
